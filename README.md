## Introduction

Node.js is a runtime environment that allows you to execute JavaScript on the server side. It is designed to build scalable network applications due to its event-driven, non-blocking I/O model, which makes it lightweight and efficient. This repository provides insights into the underlying mechanisms of Node.js, helping developers understand how it works behind the scenes.

## Event-Driven Architecture

Node.js operates on a single-threaded event loop model. Instead of creating multiple threads to handle concurrent tasks, Node.js uses a single thread to manage all operations. This is achieved through an event-driven architecture where the main thread delegates tasks to be handled asynchronously, making it highly efficient and scalable.

## Non-Blocking I/O

Node.js uses non-blocking I/O operations, allowing it to handle multiple I/O operations concurrently without blocking the execution of other code. This is achieved through callbacks, promises, and async/await mechanisms, enabling Node.js to perform efficiently under heavy I/O operations.

## The Event Loop

The event loop is the heart of Node.js's asynchronous execution. It continuously checks for pending tasks and executes them efficiently. The event loop is divided into several phases:
- **Timers**: Executes callbacks scheduled by `setTimeout()` and `setInterval()`.
- **I/O Callbacks**: Executes I/O-related callbacks.
- **Idle, Prepare**: Internal use only.
- **Poll**: Retrieves new I/O events and executes I/O-related callbacks.
- **Check**: Executes `setImmediate()` callbacks.
- **Close Callbacks**: Executes close event callbacks, such as `socket.on('close', ...)`.

## libuv

Node.js uses the libuv library to handle asynchronous I/O operations. libuv abstracts the underlying OS-specific operations and provides a consistent API for Node.js to work with. It handles tasks such as file system operations, network requests, and timers, ensuring seamless and efficient asynchronous execution.

## V8 Engine

Node.js is built on the V8 JavaScript engine, the same engine used by Google Chrome. V8 compiles JavaScript code into machine code, allowing Node.js to execute JavaScript code at high speed. This makes Node.js applications fast and efficient, leveraging the performance optimizations of V8.

## Modules

Node.js uses the CommonJS module system to manage dependencies. Each file in a Node.js application is treated as a separate module, and modules can export functionality to be used by other modules using `module.exports` and `require`. This modular approach promotes code reuse and maintainability.

## Asynchronous Programming

Node.js promotes asynchronous programming, which is essential for building scalable network applications. Developers use constructs such as callbacks, promises, and async/await to handle asynchronous operations without blocking the main thread. This enables Node.js to perform efficiently under high concurrency.

## C++ Bindings

Some parts of Node.js are written in C++ to achieve better performance and provide low-level system access. Node.js provides bindings to these C++ functions, allowing JavaScript code to invoke them. This combination of JavaScript and C++ ensures that Node.js can handle performance-critical tasks efficiently.
