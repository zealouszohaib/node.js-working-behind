Node.js operates on a single-threaded, event-driven architecture that allows it to handle multiple concurrent operations efficiently. Behind the scenes, it uses the V8 JavaScript engine to execute code and libuv to manage asynchronous I/O operations. The event loop is a core component that continuously checks for pending tasks, executing callbacks as events are triggered. This non-blocking nature makes Node.js highly scalable and suitable for building real-time applications, such as chat servers or streaming platforms, where performance and responsiveness are critical.
